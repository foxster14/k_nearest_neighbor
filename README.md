# K Nearest Neighbor
• Write a python code to split the fruit dataset into 60:40 (train:test)
  
  First 60% of the data is train and the bottom 40% is test
  
  
• Write the code for the K-nearest neighbor algorithm using Euclidean distance as a measure of dissimilarity
  
  X attributes: mass, width, height, color score
  
  Y attribute: fruit name
  
  
• Find the value of K which gives the best prediction accuracy (iterate K starting from 1 to 10)


• Plot the graph for prediction accuracy vs the value of K
